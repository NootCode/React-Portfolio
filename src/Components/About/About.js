            <p> {'\t'} I am Andre Nalbandian from California. I am currently attending Cal Poly Pomona (Go Broncos!) 
            and will be starting my 4th year in the fall of 2021. I am pursuing my Bachelors in Computer Science and I 
            very passionate about constantly learning new things.</p>

            <p>My journey started my senior year of high school in 2017 where I took my first Computer Science course. AP CS A/B.
            I was told this was one of the easier AP classes to take at my school so I took it as an attempt to boost my GPA to 
            look better on my college applications. At the time I was applying to school as a Chemical Engineering major. During my 
            Computer Science course, I fell in love with the principles of Java and being able to create virtually anything I could 
            put my mind to, from chat bots to classes that helped me with AP Calculus homework. I was in love and knew this was the major
            I have been trying to pursue my whole life. </p>

            <p> 
            Now studying at CPP, I have taken many different CS classes from Data Structures to Computer Organization and Assembly programming to 
            Design and Analysis of Algorithms. None of these classes have been easy and I have spent countless long nights trying to fix the smallest
            bug in a program but nothing has been able to slow down my passion for this field. 
            </p>

            <p> This portfolio is composed of 2 labs I made while in the IBM Accelerate program. The code has not been tweaked and 
            will be used to reflect on things I could do better as time goes on. This project has helped me immensely with CSS principles
            and has allowed me to learn so much more about front-end developement.</p>

            <p> I am very excited to see what the future holds for me and the opportunities that will come my way.</p>
